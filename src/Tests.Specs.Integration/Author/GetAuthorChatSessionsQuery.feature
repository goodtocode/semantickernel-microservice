Feature: Get Author Chat Sessions Query
As an author
When I query chat sessions optionally by date range
I get all sessions that fit the date range

Scenario: Get author chat sessions
	Given I have a definition "<def>"
	And Chat Sessions exist "<exist>"
	And I have a Author id "<id>"
	And I have a start date "<startDate>"
	And I have a end date "<endDate>"
	And chat sessions within the date range exists "<chatSessionsResultExists>"
	When I get the chat sessions
	Then The response is "<response>"
	And If the response has validation issues I see the "<responseErrors>" in the response
	And The response has a collection of chat sessions
	And Each chat session has a Key
	And Each chat session has a Date greater than start date
	And Each chat session has a Date less than end date
